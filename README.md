Hello, I have created this game for my final project. It is a simple 1 vs 1 game against a moving enemy on the screen.

Instructions
To move yourself, you will use the keys: W(jump), A(left), D(right)
To shoot blasts, you will use the space bar and you can only shoot 5 blasts at a time on the screen until they leave the screen or hit the enemy. 
Once the enemy gets blasted enough times, it will disappear from the screen and you win

Feel free to play as many times as you want because there really isn't much of a story. Just move and blast the enemy. 
Once you defeat the enemy, you will have to exit out the game and re-run it to play again
Hopefully the game makes sense and is enjoyable
